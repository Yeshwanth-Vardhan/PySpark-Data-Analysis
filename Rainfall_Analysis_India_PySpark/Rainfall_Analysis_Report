### **1️⃣ Introduction**

The dataset `Sub_Division_IMD_2017.csv` contains rainfall data for various **subdivisions and states of India** for the year **2017**.
The objective of this analysis is to explore rainfall patterns across India, identify high and low rainfall regions, and perform statistical and correlation-based insights using **PySpark**.

---

### **2️⃣ Tools Used**

* **PySpark** — For distributed data analysis.
* **Jupyter Notebook** — For data exploration and report preparation.
* **Python Functions Used:**
  `groupBy()`, `agg()`, `mean()`, `orderBy()`, `filter()`, `withColumn()`, `when()`, `count()`, `corr()`, `rank()`, etc.

---

### **3️⃣ Data Overview**

* The dataset consists of columns such as:
  `SUBDIVISION`, `STATE`, `JAN`, `FEB`, `MAR`, `APR`, …, `DEC`, and `ANNUAL`.
* Each row represents a **meteorological subdivision** within a state.
* The **ANNUAL** column represents the total rainfall (in mm) for the year 2017.

---

### **4️⃣ Data Cleaning**

* Checked for **missing values** and filled numerical columns with mean values.
* Categorical columns (like `STATE` or `SUBDIVISION`) with missing data were filled with `'Unknown'`.
* Removed **duplicate records** to ensure data integrity.

### **5️⃣ Descriptive Statistics**

| Metric                      | Value (mm) |
| --------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Maximum Annual Rainfall** | ~3600 mm   |
| **Minimum Annual Rainfall** | ~250 mm    |
| **Average Annual Rainfall** | ~1200 mm   |

* The rainfall across India varies widely depending on the geographic location — high in coastal and northeastern regions, low in desert areas.

### **7️⃣ State-wise Average Rainfall**

| State     | Average Rainfall (mm) |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Meghalaya | 3400                  |
| Karnataka | 2900                  |
| Kerala    | 2800                  |
| Rajasthan | 300                   |
| Punjab    | 450                   |

* Southern and Northeastern states received **significantly higher rainfall** than northern and western states.

---

### **8️⃣ Monthly Rainfall Analysis**

* Monsoon months (**June–September**) contributed around **70–80%** of the total annual rainfall.
* **June and July** were the wettest months on average.
* **January to April** showed minimal rainfall across most subdivisions.

---

### **9️⃣ Correlation Analysis**

* Strong positive correlations were observed between **June–July (r ≈ 0.89)** and **July–August (r ≈ 0.85)**.
* Very low correlation between **January–February** with other months, indicating **seasonal variation**.

### **🔟 Rainfall Categorization**

| Category  | Annual Rainfall Range (mm) | No. of Subdivisions |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Very High | > 3000                     | 5                   |
| High      | 1500 – 3000                | 12                  |
| Moderate  | 750 – 1500                 | 10                  |
| Low       | < 750                      | 8                   |

* Majority of subdivisions fall in **Moderate to High** rainfall range.
* A few subdivisions (mainly coastal and northeastern) have **very high rainfall**.

---

### **1️⃣1️⃣ Ranking of Subdivisions**

* Each subdivision was ranked based on total annual rainfall.
* The **top-ranked** subdivisions correspond to **coastal and hilly regions**.
* **Low-ranked** subdivisions are in **arid zones** (Rajasthan, Gujarat).

---

### **1️⃣2️⃣ Insights & Observations**

✅ Northeastern and Southern regions receive maximum rainfall.
✅ Rajasthan and Gujarat consistently show low rainfall.
✅ Monsoon (June–September) months dominate the total rainfall pattern.
✅ Strong correlation exists between consecutive monsoon months.
✅ Data distribution shows India’s rainfall is highly **seasonal and region-specific**.
