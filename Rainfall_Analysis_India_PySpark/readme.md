## **2️⃣ Operations Performed**

All the analysis was carried out using **PySpark**, leveraging its distributed data processing capabilities.

### **Data Processing Steps:**

1. **Data Loading** — Loaded the CSV file into a PySpark DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning** —

   * Checked and filled missing values.
   * Standardized column names.
   * Removed duplicates.
3. **Descriptive Statistics** — Calculated mean, min, max, and variance for rainfall data.
4. **Data Aggregation** — Computed average rainfall per state and per subdivision.
5. **Sorting & Ranking** — Identified top and bottom rainfall subdivisions.
6. **Correlation Analysis** — Analyzed rainfall correlation between months.
7. **Categorization** — Created rainfall ranges (High, Moderate, Low).
8. **Visualization** — Plotted bar charts and monthly rainfall trends using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

## **3️⃣ Key Insights**

| Insight                        | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🌧️ **Highest Rainfall**       | Coastal Karnataka, Arunachal Pradesh, and Assam–Meghalaya recorded over 3000 mm rainfall.  |
| ☀️ **Lowest Rainfall**         | Western Rajasthan, Gujarat (North), and Punjab recorded less than 500 mm.                  |
| 🕓 **Seasonal Trend**          | Monsoon months (June–September) contributed ~75–80% of the total annual rainfall.          |
| 🔁 **Strong Correlation**      | High correlation between June–July (0.89) and July–August (0.85).                          |
| 📈 **Average Annual Rainfall** | Around 1200 mm across all subdivisions.                                                    |
| 🧭 **Regional Pattern**        | Southern and Northeastern India are high rainfall zones, while Northwest regions are arid. |

## **4️⃣ Strategic Recommendations**

Based on the insights, the following strategies can be proposed:

1. **Agricultural Planning:**

   * Promote water-intensive crops (like rice) in high rainfall zones.
   * Encourage drought-resistant crops (like millets) in low rainfall regions.

2. **Water Resource Management:**

   * Implement efficient rainwater harvesting systems in low rainfall areas.
   * Construct small dams and reservoirs in high rainfall regions to store excess water.

3. **Flood & Drought Management:**

   * Establish early-warning systems in flood-prone coastal and northeastern states.
   * Introduce irrigation and water conservation schemes in drought-prone states like Rajasthan and Gujarat.

4. **Infrastructure & Policy Decisions:**

   * Plan better urban drainage systems for regions with high rainfall peaks.
   * Policy-level focus on **climate adaptation** and **sustainable water use**.

## **5️⃣ Data Filtering & Segmentation**

To gain deeper insights, the dataset was segmented using PySpark filters:

### **Filters Applied:**

1. **By Rainfall Category**

   ```python
   df.filter(col("ANNUAL") > 3000)   # Very High Rainfall
   df.filter((col("ANNUAL") >= 1500) & (col("ANNUAL") <= 3000))  # High Rainfall
   ```
2. **By State**

   ```python
   df.filter(col("STATE") == "Karnataka")
   ```
3. **By Month**

   ```python
   df.select("SUBDIVISION", "JUN", "JUL", "AUG", "SEP")
   ```
4. **By Rainfall Range**

   * `Very High`: > 3000 mm
   * `High`: 1500–3000 mm
   * `Moderate`: 750–1500 mm
   * `Low`: < 750 mm

### **Segmented Insights:**

* 5 subdivisions fall under **Very High** rainfall.
* 12 subdivisions under **High** rainfall.
* 10 under **Moderate**.
* 8 under **Low** rainfall.

## **6️⃣ Conclusion**

This rainfall analysis provided a comprehensive view of **India’s climatic diversity** using PySpark.

✅ **Findings:**

* Rainfall distribution across India is **highly uneven** and **seasonal**.
* **Monsoon months dominate** the annual rainfall contribution.
* Northeastern and coastal regions are consistently wet zones, while northwestern areas remain dry.

✅ **Impact:**

* These findings can assist **government bodies**, **agriculture departments**, and **urban planners** in making informed decisions about **water management**, **crop allocation**, and **climate adaptation** strategies.

✅ **Final Note:**
PySpark proved to be a powerful tool for handling and analyzing large datasets efficiently, making it ideal for real-world meteorological data processing and analytics.
